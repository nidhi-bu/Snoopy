The video is the app running on a virtual device on amazon device farm

The aws testing contains the following folders describing two types of test runs: 
- Automated test run: Here we use the AWS device farm to select a device pool (to which our application is compatible) and run a Built in Fuzz test with the apk file of the application. 
   - The automated test runs are done on 4 devices. The test carried out is the Built in Fuzz test. 
   - Interpretation: 
     - First we have to use the AWS device Farm to analyse the reports generated. The summary gives at which step of the code which error was encountered.  
     - In my testing, the test failed at a certain step in 2 out of the 4 devices. While nother device encountered a unique problem. 
     - Motorola Moto G 4: Fuzz test error was - *Exerciser detected crash: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Given String is empty or null*
     - Motorola Nexus 6: Fuzz test error was - *Exerciser detected crash: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Given String is empty or null*
     - LG Nexus 5X : Unique Error - *Application not responding: com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox:search*
- Remote Access Test: Here we use the AWS device farm to select a virtual device and install our applicaton on it and run and operate the application on the remote virtual device. This generates a TCP dump log, a logcat and a video that shows the steps we took while testing the application on the remote virtual device. 
     - The remote access session was carried out successfully and all features on the application were functional. 

*Monkey Test*
- The application is tested by random screen clicks. It tests whether the page is resonsive and returns in its log the argument errors and exeptions are thrown in the process. 
- The monkey test is done on android studio. 

*Test Cases:*
- The excel sheet containing various test cases that test different functionalities of the device and whether they are executing successfully on the device they are being tested on
- In the testcases generated by me, I have used one Physical device and one emualator for testing.
